# Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

This project implements an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the content of images. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images and is capable of classifying new images into predefined categories.

## Overview

The Image Classification system consists of the following components:

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: A deep learning model that automatically learns hierarchical patterns and features from images, enabling accurate classification.
- **Dataset**: A collection of labeled images used to train and evaluate the CNN model. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets.
- **Training**: The CNN model is trained on the training set using backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize the model parameters.
- **Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the validation set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Prediction**: Once trained, the model can classify new images into predefined categories with high accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The project is implemented using Python programming language, leveraging libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the CNN model.
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, used for building and training deep learning models.
- **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, used for building and training deep learning models with ease.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook is used for interactive data exploration, model development, and experimentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled images representing different categories or classes. It is important to ensure that the dataset is diverse, balanced, and representative of the target application domain to achieve robust and accurate classification results.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture typically consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, fully connected layers, and activation functions. The specific architecture may vary based on the complexity of the classification task and the characteristics of the input images.
